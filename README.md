The Password Complexity Checker is a simple Python-based application designed to evaluate the strength of a password based on predefined criteria. It ensures that users create strong and secure passwords by checking the password against common security requirements such as length, character diversity (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols). The project uses a graphical user interface (GUI) built with the tkinter library, making it user-friendly and easy to use.
